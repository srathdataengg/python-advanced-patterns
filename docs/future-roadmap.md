Here’s a clean, professional **future-roadmap.md** outline you can add to your `docs/` folder — it maps nicely to your project’s growth and shows interviewers you think ahead:

# Future Roadmap for Python Advanced Ingestion Service

## Phase 3 – Multi-threading & Multiprocessing

* Introduce parallel ingestion using Python’s `threading` and `multiprocessing` modules
* Handle CPU-bound tasks with multiprocessing for max throughput
* Explore thread-safe queues and locks to coordinate data ingestion
* Benchmark sync vs async vs threading vs multiprocessing performance

## Phase 4 – Event-driven & Streaming

* Integrate message queues like **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for event-driven ingestion
* Use stream processing frameworks (e.g., **Apache Flink**, **Spark Structured Streaming**)
* Enable near real-time data pipelines with low latency
* Implement exactly-once processing guarantees

## Phase 5 – Data Quality & Observability

* Add data validation layers with schema enforcement (e.g., **Pydantic**, **Great Expectations**)
* Track data lineage and pipeline metrics
* Set up alerting for failed ingestions and anomalies
* Centralized logging and distributed tracing integration (e.g., **OpenTelemetry**)

## Phase 6 – AI & ML Integration

* Build forecasting and anomaly detection models on ingested data
* Implement AI-powered data enrichment (e.g., entity recognition, classification)
* Integrate vector databases for semantic search and retrieval
* Develop APIs serving AI-powered insights in real time

## Phase 7 – Cloud Native & Scalability

* Container orchestration using **Kubernetes** with Helm charts
* Use managed cloud services (AWS Lambda, AWS S3, DynamoDB) for storage and compute
* CI/CD pipelines with testing, linting, and automated deployment
* Infrastructure-as-code with Terraform or CloudFormation

This roadmap not only guides your learning but signals to recruiters that you know the **full lifecycle** of scalable, production-ready data systems.

Want me to help draft the markdown file with this content, or should we jump to implementing Phase 3?
